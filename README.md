# Networking Labs Archive

This repository contains my collection of a few networking labs completed using Cisco Packet Tracer that I performed during my CCNA courses on NetAcad. It serves as my personal archive and learning journal for practicing core networking concepts.(It does not contain all the labs I created because I lost access to most of them)

## ðŸ“Œ About

These labs cover fundamental networking topics. Each lab includes a Packet Tracer file (*.pkt) and (where available) brief notes describing the lab's objectives and approach.
